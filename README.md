- This is my second project.In this project adding colour to the background image took lot of time because it was some how not working and after sometime i found out that my syntax was wrong.It was a small error but it took lot of time to solve.

- I made this project in 3-4hr and i took most of the time for adjusting font size, background color and padding.The link of the project is below:
